Looking at the PropGo.my screenshots, I'll create a comprehensive design system JSON that captures all the visual patterns, component structures, and styling conventions.I've created a comprehensive design system JSON for PropGo.my based on the screenshots provided. This design system captures:

## Key Features:

1. **Complete Color System** - Both light and dark modes with semantic color tokens
2. **Element-Specific Styling** - Precise styling rules for each component type (cards, buttons, navigation, etc.)
3. **Context-Aware Mapping** - Specific application contexts to prevent styling misplacement
4. **Visual Effect Specifications** - Exact shadow, gradient, and border radius values
5. **Component State Management** - Hover, active, focus, and disabled states
6. **Typography System** - Font families, sizes, weights, and line heights
7. **Layout Guidelines** - Grid systems, spacing, and responsive breakpoints

## Notable Design Patterns Extracted:

- **Dark sidebar navigation** (#1E293B) with blue active states (#4A6CF7)
- **Card-based layouts** with subtle shadows and rounded corners
- **Gradient-free design** focusing on solid colors and subtle shadows
- **Blue primary color** (#4A6CF7) with green secondary (#10B981)
- **Clean, minimal aesthetic** with proper spacing and typography hierarchy
- **Status-based color coding** for different states and types

## DO NOT Rules Included:

The system includes specific rules to prevent common styling misapplications like:
- Applying card gradients to icons
- Using button colors on text elements  
- Mixing sidebar styling with main content
- Incorrect shadow applications

This design system provides Cursor AI with precise, actionable data to consistently replicate PropGo.my's visual design across new implementations while maintaining design integrity and preventing styling errors.
